## Ticket Management System
Project developed during the Web Applications II course @ Politecnico di Torino. Consists of a web application to manage Customer Support Tickets of a simple e-commerce store.
The frontend is built using React.js with MUI-X framework, while backend is built using a microservice approach that includes a Spring Boot (on Kotlin) application, a PostgreSQL Database, a Keycloak instance to handle authentication, an Observability Dashboard built with Grafana, Loki, Tempo and Prometheus, and a Kafka broker to implement a real-time chat and push notification service.
